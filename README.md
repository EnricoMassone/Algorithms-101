# Algorithms-101

I created this project as a learning tool for myself. The main point of this project is offering myself a code machine to implement some well-known and fundamentals algorithms and data structures. I will keep this project open source and available for everyone.

## Project structure

The available algorithms and data structures are divided by topic.

### Search

- [Linear Search](./src/search/linearSearch.ts)
- [Binary Search](./src/search/binarySearch.ts)

## Credits

This project is inspired by the material of the following algorithms courses:

- [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/). This course is available on [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/). Course material is available [here](https://theprimeagen.github.io/fem-algos/).
- [Complete Intro to Computer Science](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science-v2/). This course is available on [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science-v2/). Course material is available [here](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-computer-science/)

## Environment

This project has been designed to be executed on a machine having Node.js 18 installed. I have tested it with Windows 10 and WSL2.

## Contribution
