# Algorithms-101

I created this project as a learning tool for myself. The main point of this project is offering myself a code machine to implement some well-known and fundamentals algorithms and data structures. I will keep this project open source and available for everyone.

## Project structure

The available algorithms and data structures are divided by topic.

### Search

- [Linear Search](./src/search/linearSearch.ts)
- [Binary Search](./src/search/binarySearch.ts)
- [Two crystal balls problem](./src/search/twoCrystalBalls.ts)

### Sorting

- [Bubble sort](./src/sort/bubbleSort.ts)
- [Quick sort](./src/sort/quickSort.ts)

### Data structures

- [Queue](./src/data-structures/queue.ts)
- [Stack](./src/data-structures/stack.ts)
- [Doubly Linked List](./src/data-structures/doublyLinkedList.ts)
- [Min Heap](./src/data-structures/minHeap.ts)

### Recursion

- [Maze Solver](./src/recursion/mazeSolver.ts)

### Trees

- [Binary Tree Pre Order Traversal](./src/trees/binaryTreePreorderTraversal.ts)
- [Binary Tree In Order Traversal](./src/trees/binaryTreeInOrderTraversal.ts)
- [Binary Tree Post Order Traversal](./src/trees/binaryTreePostOrderTraversal.ts)
- [Binary Tree Breath First Traversal](./src/trees/binaryTreeBreathFirstTraversal.ts)
- [Binary Tree Beath First Search](./src/trees/binaryTreeBreathFirstSearch.ts)
- [Depth First Search on a Binary Search Tree](./src/trees/depthFirstSearchOnBinarySearchTree.ts)
- [Binary Tree Equality Check](./src/trees/binaryTreeComparison.ts)

### Graphs

- [Breath First Search on a graph](./src/graphs/graphBreathFirstSearch.ts)

## Credits

This project is inspired by the material of the following algorithms courses:

- [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/). This course is available on [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/). Course material is available [here](https://theprimeagen.github.io/fem-algos/).
- [Complete Intro to Computer Science](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science-v2/). This course is available on [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science-v2/). Course material is available [here](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-computer-science/)

## Environment

This project has been designed to be executed on a machine having Node.js 18 installed. I have tested it with Windows 10 and WSL2.

## Contribution

If you find any issue with the code or any typo in the readme feel free to open a pull request or to file an issue.
